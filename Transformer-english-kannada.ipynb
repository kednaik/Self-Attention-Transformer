Additionally, RNNs struggle with capturing long-term dependencies due to the vanishing/exploding gradient problem.\n","  \n","2. **LSTM and GRU (Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units):** These models introduced gating mechanisms to store long-term information, helping mitigate the vanishing gradient issue. However, their sequential nature still limits parallel processing.\n","\n","3. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks):** While CNNs can process data in parallel, they technically still handle inputs sequentially and struggle to capture long-term dependencies.\n","\n","To address these challenges, the Transformer model was introduced, which leverages self-attention mechanisms. Instead of relying only on the last state of the encoder, the Transformer calculates a weighted sum of all previous encoder states, enabling it to capture long-term dependencies. This mechanism allows the decoder to assign appropriate weight to each input element, improving the relevance of information for generating outputs.\n","\n","However, a significant limitation remains: each sequence is still processed one step at a time. Both the encoder and decoder must wait for the completion of previous steps before processing the current one, making this approach computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when handling large datasets."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fN7pJARIt9uK"},"source":["## Loading the libraries"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"t5DbIHC-F6Hf"},"source":["Load and install, if necessary, the python libraries we will use along this notebook"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":151,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1499,"status":"ok","timestamp":1604164306003,"user":{"displayName":"Eduardo Muñoz Sala","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi9gTFB7xfdxQyNiKRUzqE5vwb9WQjQuMtQz5F16w=s64","userId":"13317831924226771761"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"ZbcvtPlp3YWu"},"outputs":[],"source":["import math\n","import os\n","import gc\n","import time\n","import re\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":152,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2911,"status":"ok","timestamp":1604164318361,"user":{"displayName":"Eduardo Muñoz Sala","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi9gTFB7xfdxQyNiKRUzqE5vwb9WQjQuMtQz5F16w=s64","userId":"13317831924226771761"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"P6o_cpZz3y_-"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","\n","from tensorflow.keras import layers\n","from tensorflow.keras import backend as K\n","import tensorflow_datasets as tfds\n","\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bqyCyv2b5iif"},"source":["Setting some parameters and hyperparameters for our model"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":153,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":984,"status":"ok","timestamp":1604164327404,"user":{"displayName":"Eduardo Muñoz Sala","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi9gTFB7xfdxQyNiKRUzqE5vwb9WQjQuMtQz5F16w=s64","userId":"13317831924226771761"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"rTr3QS6_5tBO"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Parameters for our model\n","INPUT_COLUMN = 'original_instruction'\n","TARGET_COLUMN = 'translated_instruction'\n","NUM_SAMPLES = 200000\n","MAX_VOCAB_SIZE = 2**15\n","\n","BATCH_SIZE = 64  # Batch size for training.\n","EPOCHS = 10  # Number of epochs to train for.\n","MAX_LENGTH = 50"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BQN8jwx48_yU"},"source":["## The dataset and text processing\n","\n","We'll be using dataset, https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cognitive-Lab/Kannada-Instruct-dataset for data translation, English to Kannada.
